This workspace contains an Electron app with a React (Vite) frontend. The app will serve as a GUI for the bibneat C++/WASM library for managing BibTeX files. Prioritize simple, well-documented code and clear separation between Electron main process and React renderer. Integrate with local WASM files and provide UI for bibneat features as described in the project documentation.
